            <center><img src="static\kidney_images.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="500" alt="Kidney image"></center>
            <h4>Overview:</h4>
            <p>The kidneys play key roles in body function, not only by filtering the blood and getting rid of waste
                products, but also by balancing the electrolyte levels in the body, controlling blood pressure, and
                stimulating the production of red blood cells.
                The kidneys are located in the abdomen toward the back, normally one on each side of the spine. They get
                their blood supply through the renal arteries directly from the aorta and send blood back to the heart
                via the renal veins to the vena cava. (The term "renal" is derived from the Latin name for kidney.)</p>

            <h4>What is Chronical Kidney Disease?</h4>
            <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and can’t filter blood the way they should.
                The disease is called “chronic” because the damage to your kidneys happens slowly over a long period of
                time. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. CKD can also cause other health problems.
            </p>

            <h4>Symptoms of advanced CKD</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>chest pain, dry skin, shortness of breath</li>
                <li>itching or numbness, sleep problems, vomiting</li>
                <li>headaches,increased or decreased urination, trouble concentrating</li>

            <center><img src="static\heart_image.png" class="img-fluid" width="500" alt="Kidney image"></center>
            <h5>Overview:</h5>
            <p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease
                umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems
                (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
                The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease."
                Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels
                that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those
                that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.
                Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>
            <h5>Symptoms:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
                <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of
                    your body are narrowed</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>

        <!-- Diabetes Disease -->

            <h1>Diabetes Disease:</h1>
            <center><img src="static\Diabetes_image.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="500" alt="Kidney image"></center>
            <h5>Overview:</h5>
            <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood
                glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the
                pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t
                make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t
                reach your cells.
                Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no
                cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.
